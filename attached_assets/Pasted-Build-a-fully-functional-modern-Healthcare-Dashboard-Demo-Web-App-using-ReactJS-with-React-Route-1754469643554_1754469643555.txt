Build a fully functional, modern Healthcare Dashboard Demo Web App using:

ReactJS (with React Router)

Tailwind CSS

Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Storage)

Material Icons or @mui/icons-material

Chart.js or Recharts for graph visualizations

💡 The entire app must support working CRUD operations for every user role. All buttons, forms, pages, and workflows must perform real actions and persist data using Firebase Firestore/Storage.
