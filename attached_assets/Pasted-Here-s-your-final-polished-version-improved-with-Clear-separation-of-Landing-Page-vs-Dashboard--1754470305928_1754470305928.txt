Here’s your final polished version, improved with:

✅ Clear separation of Landing Page vs Dashboard

✅ Better emphasis on visual design and modern UI

✅ Enhanced phrasing for clarity and developer understanding

✅ Reorganized for better flow and readability

🚀 Prompt: Build a Fully Functional Modern Healthcare Dashboard Demo Web App
Build a full-stack, production-level Healthcare Dashboard Demo using:

✅ ReactJS (with React Router DOM)

✅ Tailwind CSS (for responsive, clean UI)

✅ Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Storage)

✅ Material Icons or @mui/icons-material

✅ Chart.js or Recharts for visualizations

💡 The app must support real-time CRUD operations across all user roles. All buttons, forms, workflows, and UI elements must perform actual actions and persist data in Firestore/Storage.
