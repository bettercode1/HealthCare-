### Components Structure

```
src/components/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ FamilyManagement.tsx          # Main family management page
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ FamilyMembers.tsx             # Family members list component

medicationAPI.getMedications()
medicationAPI.createMedication(medicationData)
medicationAPI.updateMedication(id, updates)
medicationAPI.deleteMedication(id)

// Dose Tracking API
doseAPI.getDoseRecords()
doseAPI.createDoseRecord(doseData)
doseAPI.updateDoseRecord(id, updates)
doseAPI.generateDoseRecords(medicationId, startDate, endDate)

// Health Reports API
reportAPI.getReports()
reportAPI.createReport(reportData)
reportAPI.updateReport(id, updates)
reportAPI.deleteReport(id)

// AI Disease Analysis API
diseaseAnalysisAPI.getDiseaseAnalysis()
